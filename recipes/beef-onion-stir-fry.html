        The perfectly flavored beef and onions may be served with hot cooked rice or noodles. Add a simple Chinese cucumber salad or side vegetable for a well-rounded meal.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1. In a medium bowl, add the flank steak, baking soda, cornstarch, oil, oyster sauce, and water. Mix until the liquid has been absorbed, and set aside to marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes.
