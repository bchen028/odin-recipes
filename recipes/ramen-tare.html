        <h2><strong>What Is Ramen Tare?</strong></h2>
        <p>As said on <a href="https://www.umami-insider.com/recipe-ramen-tare-japanese-sauce/">Umami Insider</a> think of tare as a concentrated flavoring agent of Japanese soups you can add to any ramen broth. You can include additional secondary ingredients, such as niboshi (dried sardines) lemongrass and chili flakes, to suit your tastes, but maintain a base of two parts stock to one part each soy sauce and mirin. Add tare to ramen broth to taste unless your recipe specifies otherwise.</p>

        <p>Also stated on <a href="https://allwaysdelicious.com/ramen-tare/">Allwaysdelicious</a>" The word “tare” is Japanese for “sauce.” In ramen recipes, it refers to a concentrated seasoning mixture that is placed in the serving bowl before the noodles, broth, and toppings are added.</p>

        <p>Ramen tare is what gives a bowl of ramen its deep, rich, distinctive flavor. Each ramen shop and chef has their own secret tare recipes, and those recipes are closely guarded.</p>

        <h2><strong>Different Types Of Ramen Tare?</strong></h2>

        <p><a href="https://allwaysdelicious.com/ramen-tare/">Allwaysdelicious</a> states there are 3 primary types of ramen tare:</p>

        <h4><strong>Shoyu(soy sauce)</strong></h4>
        <p><em>Shoyu</em> means soy sauce. This is the oldest and most traditional tare. It provides the concentrated flavor for shoyu ramen. It can be a simple blend of soy sauce, sake, and mirin, or it may include a dozen ingredients like kombu, chili peppers, and bonito flakes.</p>

        <h4><strong>Shio(salt)</strong></h4>
        <p><em>Shio</em> tares start with a base of salt (shio means salt). Shio tare is sometimes made of just water, salt, and sake. It can also have a complex layering of ingredients like kombu (dried kelp), shiitake mushrooms, dried sardines, dried anchovies, sugar, mirin, sake, and bonito flakes (dried fish flakes).</p>

        <h4><strong>Miso</strong></h4>
        <p>Made from a base of <em>miso</em>—a salty paste made from fermented soybeans and other grains. Miso tare usually combines miso paste with other ingredients like mirin, sake, ginger, sesame paste, and soy sauce. </p>
